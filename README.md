This GitHub repository is my personal project dedicated to analyzing order trends using Google Data Studio. Leveraging the platform's robust visualization and analysis tools, I aim to delve into order patterns over time and across various dimensions like categories, quantities, segments, states, and regions.

By connecting a dataset containing order information to Google Data Studio, I can explore, visualize, and interpret trends to make informed decisions and optimize business operations. Whether examining yearly trends, monthly variations, or delving into specific categories, this project provides a comprehensive toolkit for dissecting and understanding order data.

Google Data Studio's visualization capabilities allow me to create intuitive charts, graphs, and maps, facilitating the identification of patterns and outliers within the dataset. With these insights, I can uncover hidden opportunities, detect potential issues, and make data-driven decisions to drive business growth.
